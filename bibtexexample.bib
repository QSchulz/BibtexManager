However the process of building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and HMAS is mostly different from the process of building more traditional software systems as it introduces new design and development challenges. This paper introduces an agent-oriented software process for engineering complex systems called ASPECS. ASPECS is based on a holonic organisational metamodel and provides a step-by- step guide from requirements to code allowing the modelling of a system at different levels of details using a set of refinement methods. This paper details the entire ASPECS development process and provides a set of methodological guidelines for each process activity. A complete case study is also used to illustrate the design process and the associated notations. ASPECS uses UML as a modelling language. Because of the specific needs of agents and holonic organisational design, the UML 
semantics and notation are used as reference points, but they have been extended by introducing new specific profiles.},

	abstract = {Simulation, which creates abstractions of the system is an appropriate approach for studying complex systems that are inaccessible through direct observation and measurement. The problem with simulation of great numbers of interacting entities is that it is difficult to create a reliable and tractable abstraction of the real system. Indeed, simulating large numbers of entities requires great computing resources. A solution to avoid this problem is to use macroscopic models. However, this type of model may be unavailable or not reliable for the problem at hand and it does not allow the observation of individual behaviours. In this paper, a multilevel simulation model is proposed to allow the use of both microscopic and macroscopic techniques. This model is based upon Holonic Multi-Agent Systems which offer a promising approach for developing applications in complex domains characterised by a hierarchical structure. The proposed approach provides a generic scheduling model for multilevel 
simulations: dynamically adapting the level of simulated behaviours while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. It does not only manage the level of entities’ behaviour but also of behaviours classically assigned to the environmental part of a simulation. A set of physics-based indicators is also introduced to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity and to maintain the best trade-off between simulation accuracy and constraints (dependent on the model or the experimental context).},

Many simulators aimed at studying vehicles dynamics are existing. Most of them are focusing on mechanical simulation of the vehicle with a special focus on tyre/road contact. The main drawback of these is the requirement of real vehicle (this can be a simple prototype) to build a dynamical model. Another drawback is the difficulty to integrate virtual sensors and onboard artificial intelligence abilities. The aim of Virtual Intelligent Vehicle Urban Simulator is thus to overcome the general drawbacks of classical solutions by providing the possibility of designing vehicle virtual prototype with well simulated embedded sensors.

The consequence is that organizations are very dependent on method designers' skills. In this paper, we propose an approach based on SME for constructing customized agent oriented design processes. Our approach adopts the metamodel as the most important factor leading to the selection and assembly of method fragments and an algorithm for establishing the instantiation order of metamodel elements. The algorithm makes the proposed approach repeatable and usable even by not very skilled personnel, thus proposing an improvement to the actual situation. The proposed approach and the algorithm are also experimented through the construction of a design process (ASPECS) for developing dynamic hierarchical societies of agents. The approach we created is general 
enough to be applied in other development contexts (not only agent-oriented).},

The reason is that when massive number of autonomous components interact it is very difficult to predict that the emergent organizational structure fits the system goals or that the desired functionalities will be fulfilled.

However verification approaches are limited by the state- space of the system under study. This paper proposes an approach based upon an organizational framework and specifically the capacity concept which enables to abstract a role know-how and to reduce the state space of the system under study.

Accurately simulate in real-time complex systems, where a great number of entities interact, requires extensive computational resources and often distribution of the simulation over various computers. A possible solution to these issues is multilevel simulation. This kind of simulation aims at dynamically adapting the level of entities’ behaviors (microscopic, macroscopic) while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. We propose a holonic organizational multilevel model for real-time simulation of complex systems by exploiting the hierarchical and distributed properties of the holarchies. To fully exploit this model, we estimate the deviation of simulation accuracy between two adjacent levels through physics-based indicators. These indicators will then allow us to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity in the application to maintain 
the best compromise between simulation accuracy and available resources. Finally a 3D real-time multilevel simulation of pedestrians is presented as well as a discussion of experimental results.},

The aim is to develop an intelligent transportation system based on a fleet of fully automated cars designed for short trips at low speed in urban areas. This system will offer advantages of high flexibility, efficiency, safety, and thus, will improve the quality of life in our cities including but not restricted to protection of the environment, better management of parking areas, and others. One of the key functions that such transportation system must achieve concerns the notion of autonomous navigation of vehicles. To reach this goal, we are working on vehicle environment perception using passive and active sensor technologies. In this chapter, we address an artificial-vision based environment perception system for autonomous vehicle navigation. We are particularly interested in obstacle detection using stereo vision, image road line tracking for vehicle road, 
line following and landmarks recognition for local positioning. The developed techniques are implemented and have been tested using a fully automated vehicle platform for autonomous navigation in urban areas.},

Indeed, the human immune system exhibits learning capabilities and is able to adapt to environmental changes. The human immune system is a subject of great research interest because it provides a powerful and flexible information processing capability as a decentralised intelligent system. The immune system provides an excellent model of adaptive operation at the local level and of emergent behaviour at the global level. There exist several theories to explain immunological phenomena and software models for simulating various components of the immune system. Among the existing theories the idiotypic network of Jerne is chosen and analysed in order to identify the necessary components to implement it as an agent architecture. This mechanism is illustrated through the decision making mechanism of a Multi- Agent System for robot soccer simulation.},

We focus on a particular kind of multi-agent based simulation where a collection of interacting autonomous situated entities evolve in a situated environment.

The aim is to speed up the execution of a multi-agent based simulation while controlling the precision of the associated approximation. This approach may be considered as the first step of a larger effort aiming at designing a generic kernel to support efficient large-scale multi-agent based simulations.

	abstract = {This article introduces a novel approach to increase the performances of N-body simulations. In an N-body simulation, we wish to evaluate all pairwise interactions between N bodies or particles. The direct computation of all pairwise interactions requires O(N2) time, which is clearly prohibitive for a very large N. Our approach combines the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) coming from computational physics with motion levels of detail from computer graphics. The main goal is to speed up the execution of the N-body simulations while controlling the precision of the associated approximation, a natural trade-off between accuracy and efficiency common in the field of simulation. At each simulation cycle, the motion levels of detail are generated automatically and the appropriate ones are chosen adaptively to reduce computational costs. The new approach follows the overall structure of the FMM. However, clusters are approximated using their Center of Mass (CoM) in force computations. A similarity measure 
is used to decide which clusters can be approximated without any significant loss in the accuracy of the simulation. The proposed approach is tested for Coulombic system, in which N charges induce potentials to each other. The preliminary results show a significant complexity reduction without any remarkable loss in the visual appearance of the simulation, indicating the potential use of the proposed model in the simulation of a wide range of N-Body systems.},

	abstract = {The work, presented in this PhD thesis, is concerned with the study of complex systems and aims at providing a full set of abstractions and the associated methodological guidelines for the analysis, design, implementation and simulation of Holonic MultiAgent Systems (HMAS). HMAS offers a promising software engineering approach for developing complex open software systems. This kind of systems consists in self-similar structures called holons. A set of holons may be seen, depending on the level of observation, as a unique entity or as a group of holons in interaction. A complex system is made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions. In such systems, the behavior of the whole cannot be directly understood only by knowing the behavior of the parts and their interactions. Complex systems often exhibit a hierarchical structure. The foundation of this thesis consist in exploiting the intrinsic hierarchical structure of complex systems to analyse and decompose them. In order to 
conceive modular and reusable models, an organizational approach is adopted. The principle of the analysis is based on the identification of a hierarchy of organizations, which the global behavior may represent the system under the chosen perspective. The behaviors of the system are recursively decomposed into a set of interacting sub-behaviors, each of these latter being in turn decomposed until we reach some lowest level of elementary sub-behaviors. At a given level, the composed behavior is modeled using an organization, and the associated sub-behaviors using roles. This hierarchical organization structure is then mapped to an holarchy (hierarchy of holons) in charge of its execution. The concepts presented are then used to study the issues related to the multilevel multiagent simulation. The resulting model is finally applied to the pedestrians simulation in virtual urban environment.},
